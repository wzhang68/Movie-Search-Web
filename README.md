# Movie-Search-Web

movies and TV shows using the TMDB API and upon selection can display results on the details
page of that specific movie or TV show. Users can view popular, top-rated and trending movies and
TV shows on the home page along with currently playing movies. The user will first open Home page, where the navbar contains Search Bar and user can enter the

images using “autocomplete”. Selecting the movie or TV show name will lead to the details page
of that movie or TV show.
